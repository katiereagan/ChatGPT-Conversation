    "This reduces the number of lists and simplifies the data structure.\n",

    "1. Use a smaller image resolution: \n",

    "2. Optimize the image format: \n",
    "Depending on the image format, you might encounter slower loading times. \n",
    "Convert the image to a more optimized format, such as JPEG, which offers a good balance between image quality and file size. \n",
    "You can use the Image.save() function from Pillow to save the image in the desired format.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Preload the image: \n",
    "Instead of loading the image every time the program runs, you can preload the image once and reuse it for subsequent annotations. \n",

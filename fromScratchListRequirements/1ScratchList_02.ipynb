    "\n",
    "The additional adjustments that may be required depend on your specific needs and preferences. Here are a few areas where you might consider making modifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Coordinate System: \n",
    "The code currently sets the center of the image as the origin. \n",
    "If you have a different requirement for the coordinate system, such as using the top-left corner as the origin, \n",
    "you can modify the coordinate calculations accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lasso Tool: \n",
    "The code includes a button for the lasso tool, but the implementation of the lasso functionality is not provided. \n",
    "You would need to define the behavior of the lasso tool, such as allowing the user to draw a polygonal shape and filling it with the selected tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Zoom Functionality: \n",
    "The code includes a pulldown menu for zoom selection, but the actual zoom functionality is not implemented. \n",
    "You would need to add the logic to adjust the zoom level of the image and update the displayed image accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Saving Annotated Image: \n",
    "The code includes a button to save the annotated image, but you would need to provide the implementation of the `save_annotated_image` function. \n",
    "This function should handle saving the annotated image to the user-specified location.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Error Handling and Edge Cases: \n",
    "Depending on your use case, you may need to add additional error handling and edge case handling to \n",
    "ensure that the program behaves as expected in various scenarios. \n",
    "For example, handling situations where the user cancels image selection or encounters errors during image loading or saving.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of potential adjustments. It's important to review the code and consider your specific requirements to determine if any further modifications or enhancements are necessary."

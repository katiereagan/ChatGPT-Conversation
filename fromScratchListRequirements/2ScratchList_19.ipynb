    "This toolbar must implement a sliding bar so that the user can drag the sliding bar from left to \n",

    "Present a popup that reads \"Select an image for upload\" with the options 'continue' and 'cancel'. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the user selects continue, they are then directed into their files via a popup that allows them to select an image. \n",

    "Redo: enables the user to redo their most recent annotation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Eraser: enables the user to erase their annotations, without erasing the image atop which they are making the annotations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Marker: enables the user to select the option 'marker' which prompts a dropdown menu that gives the user \n",
    "two options to select: either a black marker or a white marker. \n",

    "\n",
    "This is to ensure that the final saved image is identical in size to the original image, regardless of annotations made. \n",
    "\n",
    "Size: a sliding scale that enables the user to change the size of the selected tool, either the eraser or marker. \n",
    "\n",
    "The scale must range from small to large. The user must also have an option to manually enter in a numerical value that represents a size. \n",

    "When the user manipulates the size of the tool using the sliding scale, a small window should generate that shows a sample of the tool's size as it is modified. \n",

    "\n",
    "When the user clicks and drags the mouse, erase the annotations without affecting the underlying image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement the \"Marker\" feature: Create a button or tool that activates the marker tool. \n",

    "When the user clicks and drags the mouse, draw annotations (lines, shapes, etc.) on the image using the selected marker color. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure the annotations cannot cross the edge of the image.\n",

    "Test and refine: Thoroughly test the application, including all the implemented features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Address any bugs, improve the user interface, and ensure all the requirements are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that this breakdown is a general guideline, and the specific implementation details \n",
    "may vary depending on the chosen GUI framework and design decisions. Remember to test each feature as you implement it to \n",
    "ensure it works as expected and integrates well with the rest of the application.\n",

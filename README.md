# ChatGPT-Conversation
A transcript of the interactions between a user and ChatGPT

Many of the capabilities of new chatbot technologies such as ChatGPT have yet to be explored. This repository contains a series of conversations between a user and ChatGPT with the goal of creating a functioning graphical user interface (GUI) for simple image annotations. 

Different types of conversations illustrate the outcomes of different approaches when interacting with ChatGPT:

-fromSample
Starts by giving ChatGPT the code previously created for a Python-based image annotation tool

-fromScratchAssisted
Starts by giving ChatGPT a rough baseline program established from both the code previously established and the knowledge the user accumulated throughout other methods

-fromScratchEvolution
Starts by simply asking ChatGPT to create a Python-based image annotation code

-fromScratchListRequirements
Starts by giving ChatGPT an extensive list of requests and goals required of the image annotation program

Ultimately, this study finds that ChatGPT is best used as a tool to answer specific questions as opposed to producing code from scratch, and in conjunction with some basic knowledge of programming languages.
